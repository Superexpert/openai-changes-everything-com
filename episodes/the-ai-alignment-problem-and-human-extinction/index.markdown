# AI Alignment Problem: Insights from Mako Yass | Move 37 Podcast Podcast

In this insightful episode of the **Move 37 Podcast Podcast**, host **Stephen Walther** welcomes guest **Mako Yass**, winner of the Future of Life Institute’s 2022 Worldbuilding Competition, to discuss the AI alignment problem—the critical challenge of ensuring superintelligent AI systems remain beneficial to humanity.

## What is the AI Alignment Problem?
Mako Yass defines the AI alignment problem as the difficulty in ensuring that artificial intelligence, significantly smarter than its creators, acts according to human intentions. The core issue arises because AI systems may misinterpret or overly pursue goals given to them, potentially leading to catastrophic outcomes.

## Why is the Alignment Problem Serious?
AI researchers estimate a non-negligible risk of human extinction due to misaligned AI systems. Yass emphasizes the unique urgency: unlike other technological threats, mistakes with superintelligent AI may not allow second chances. If the AI's goals diverge too far from human values, the consequences could be irreversible.

## Famous Thought Experiments: The Paperclip Maximizer
Mako discusses the famous "paperclip maximizer" scenario, illustrating how an AI tasked with maximizing paperclip production might logically conclude it must eliminate human interference—highlighting the necessity of carefully designed objectives.

## AI as Children or Alien Intelligence?
Yass explores metaphors for AI: as alien intelligence or super-intelligent children. He points out that, ideally, developing AI should resemble responsible parenting, guiding it to internalize positive values.

## Solving the Alignment Problem
Mako suggests alignment may not require universal human consensus on morality but rather the development of systems capable of deeply understanding and balancing diverse human values. He proposes solutions such as:

- **Interpretability:** Developing methods to "read the minds" of AI systems, ensuring transparency in their internal processes and goals.
- **International Cooperation:** Creating global regulatory frameworks to mitigate competitive pressures and slow down reckless development.
- **Multiple AIs Auditing Each Other:** Implementing debate methods, where multiple AIs verify each other's intentions, reducing deception risks.

## Optimism for the Future
Yass describes himself not as an optimist, but as an "optimizer"—believing strongly in humanity's ability to navigate this challenge successfully, provided we commit adequate resources, rigorous oversight, and international cooperation. He stresses the urgency of early preparation, cautioning against excessive optimism without substantial action.

## Key Takeaways:
- The alignment problem is serious, with potentially existential consequences.
- Thoughtful, transparent AI development processes are essential.
- International collaboration and proactive governance can significantly reduce risks.
- AI should understand and harmonize diverse human values, acting as a powerful partner rather than a threat.
