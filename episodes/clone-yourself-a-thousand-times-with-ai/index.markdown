# Digital Twins: Cloning Yourself with AI | Move 37 Podcast Podcast Summary

In this episode of the **Move 37 Podcast** podcast, host **Stephen Walther** interviews **Hassan Raza**, co-founder and CEO of **Tavus**, a groundbreaking startup creating digital twin experiences through advanced generative AI technology. The conversation explores how digital twins can significantly alter how people interact, learn, and work.

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is an advanced virtual replica of yourselfâ€”capturing your appearance, voice, knowledge, and mannerisms. This AI-powered clone can represent you in videos, conversations, and interactions, extending your reach and capabilities beyond physical limitations.

### Two Primary Use Cases:
1. **Personalized Video Generation:**
   - Enables creation of thousands of personalized videos instantly.
   - Ideal for tailored marketing, sales pitches, and individualized educational content.

2. **Real-Time Conversational Interaction:**
   - Engages in live, real-time conversations, replicating your personality and expertise.
   - Facilitates personalized interactions, such as virtual educators, sales representatives, and customer support.

## Practical Applications and Benefits

- **Education:** Digital twins can offer personalized, one-to-one tutoring, adapting teaching methods uniquely tailored to individual learning styles and needs.
- **Sales and Marketing:** Companies can deliver highly personalized pitches to thousands of potential customers simultaneously.
- **Translation and Accessibility:** Videos can be instantly translated into multiple languages, expanding global reach without additional recording.

## Technology and Integration

- Tavus simplifies digital twin creation with easy-to-use APIs, requiring only a two-minute video to create a detailed AI replica.
- The platform supports integrations with various applications, enhancing workflows across education, sales, recruitment, and marketing.
- Advanced conversational AI models from Tavus use real-time interaction and facial recognition to create realistic, engaging conversations.

## Ethical Considerations and Safeguards

- **Consent and Disclosure:** Digital twins are created only with explicit consent, and disclosure of AI-generated content is strongly recommended.
- **Moderation and Control:** Built-in content moderation systems prevent misuse, ensuring digital twins remain appropriate and ethical in their interactions.
- **Human Oversight:** Tavus emphasizes digital twins as extensions of human capabilities, not replacements. Important roles like legal representation remain strictly human responsibilities.

## Future Potential and Vision

- Tavus envisions a future where digital twins empower individuals to extend their influence, knowledge, and interactions far beyond traditional limits.
- Hassan Raza expresses excitement for transformative educational opportunities, envisioning personalized learning companions available to every student worldwide.
