## How AI Teaching Assistants Could Revolutionize Higher Education

In this episode of the **"Move 37 Podcast"** podcast, host Stephen Walther interviews **Paul Truax**, the visionary co-founder and CEO of **Cognify**, a groundbreaking startup aiming to reshape higher education using personalized artificial intelligence. They discuss how Cognify's innovative platform leverages AI to create personalized, course-specific teaching assistants, revolutionizing the way college students interact with course material, learn new concepts, and succeed academically.

### What is Cognify and How Does It Work?

Cognify is an educational technology company dedicated to developing highly personalized, course-specific AI teaching assistants. Unlike general-purpose models such as ChatGPT, Cognify assistants are specifically trained on individual course materials, including textbooks, professor lectures, previous exams, and specialized educational content. The result is an AI tutor uniquely tailored to the needs of students in each specific course, providing highly accurate, context-aware, and detailed academic support.

Students using Cognify can:

- Access concise summaries of textbook chapters.
- Generate unlimited practice problems precisely matching the style, format, and difficulty level of their course.
- Receive step-by-step explanations and real-world examples, contextualized to their geographic university location, reinforcing learning through relatable scenarios.
- Benefit from adaptive learning conversations where the AI assesses the student's current understanding before delivering personalized insights.

Professors benefit by gaining unprecedented visibility into student engagement through a sophisticated, privacy-protecting dashboard. The dashboard reveals insights such as:

- Which course topics students struggle with the most.
- The types and frequency of student queries.
- Trends in student engagement at different times throughout the semester.

However, this dashboard carefully protects student anonymity, ensuring professors never see personal information or individual student identities.

### The Core Problem Cognify Solves: Bloom's 2 Sigma

A central focus of the episode is how Cognify tackles the longstanding educational challenge known as **Bloom's 2 Sigma problem**. Originating from a landmark 1984 study, Bloom's 2 Sigma revealed that individualized tutoring could boost a student's learning outcomes by two standard deviations—a dramatic improvement in academic performance. However, personalized tutoring was previously economically impractical at scale.

Paul explains how, for the first time, Cognify makes the **Bloom’s 2 Sigma effect achievable at scale**, using personalized AI tutoring assistants. These AI tutors significantly improve learning effectiveness, providing an affordable and practical solution to individualized education previously considered impossible.

### Why Not Just Use ChatGPT or General AI Tools?

Stephen questions why students should choose Cognify over general AI tools such as ChatGPT or Google's Notebook LM. Paul highlights Cognify’s distinct advantages:

- **Course-Specific Knowledge:** General models lack course-specific context. Cognify's AI knows exactly what professors prioritize and matches the exact difficulty level and content structure of each individual class.
- **Personalization:** Cognify’s AI adapts to student comprehension levels, provides targeted practice problems, and even uses geographically relevant examples to reinforce learning.
- **Improved Accuracy and Reduced Hallucinations:** Cognify carefully prepares professor-submitted course material to train their AI, dramatically reducing the errors or "hallucinations" common in general AI models trained on unstructured content.

Paul emphasizes that general AI tools can complement Cognify, but course-specific personalization is critical for deep, effective learning.

### Student Privacy and Ethical AI Practices

Addressing concerns about student privacy, Paul underscores Cognify’s robust data encryption and strict policies:

- Professors and universities receive aggregate student data only, never personally identifiable information.
- The platform protects student anonymity, ensuring learners feel comfortable asking any questions without stigma or fear of judgment.
- Cognify actively refuses institutional requests for raw student data, emphasizing their commitment to ethical data handling and student privacy.

### Could AI Replace Teaching Assistants (TAs)?

Stephen raises concerns about AI potentially replacing human teaching assistants, potentially impacting the valuable social and motivational interactions students have. Paul acknowledges the possibility that certain administrative TA duties—like answering basic questions—might become automated. However, he firmly believes that TAs and professors will remain essential for providing motivation, empathy, guidance, and the "why" behind learning, something AI cannot authentically replicate.

Rather than replacing TAs, Cognify’s vision is to empower professors and TAs to focus on more meaningful student interactions by eliminating tedious, repetitive tasks.

### Product Vision and Future Enhancements

Paul shares exciting plans for Cognify’s future:

- **Conversational Speech Mode:** Cognify will soon introduce an audio-based conversational mode, allowing students to discuss and learn through interactive speech-to-speech exchanges.
- **Enhanced Memory Capabilities:** Future enhancements include personalized memory tracking, enabling the AI to better remember and adapt to individual student needs, learning preferences, and past interactions.
- **Advanced Group Learning Capabilities:** In collaboration with partners like Nvidia, Cognify plans a groundbreaking group learning mode, enabling multiple students to collaboratively interact with a single AI tutor, fostering dynamic, shared learning experiences.

### How Cognify Integrates with Existing Learning Management Systems (LMS)

Cognify does not plan to become a full LMS platform. Instead, it will deeply integrate with existing popular LMS platforms (e.g., Canvas, Blackboard). Paul envisions Cognify complementing LMS tools by adding personalized tutoring and enhanced study experiences, rather than attempting to replace them.

However, Cognify does see itself eventually competing directly with educational tools like Quizlet, believing they can dramatically enhance traditional study methods through their sophisticated AI-driven approach.

### Measuring Success: Engagement and Impact

Currently, Cognify tracks student engagement metrics (frequency of use, types of queries, and timing) combined with qualitative feedback to measure success. Paul recognizes the importance of establishing clear, objective metrics (such as exam performance improvements or reduced study time) in the future. Integrations with LMS systems will allow Cognify to quantify these impacts more concretely.

### Conclusion and the Big Picture Vision

Ultimately, Cognify’s ambitious goal is to redefine how students learn by providing every student with a personalized AI teaching assistant, fulfilling the promise of individualized education once deemed impossible. Paul expresses excitement about Cognify's rapid progress and growing partnerships and confidently predicts a future where AI significantly improves student outcomes, empowers educators, and reshapes the educational landscape.
