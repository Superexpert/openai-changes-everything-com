# Simplifying Data Analytics with AI: Interview with Marko Klopets of Supersimple

In this episode of **"OpenAI Changes Everything,"** host Stephen Walther interviews Marko Klopets, the co-founder and CEO of **Supersimple**, an innovative AI-driven data analytics platform designed to empower product managers and go-to-market (GTM) teams.

## The AI Reliability Paradox

Artificial Intelligence promises to simplify complex tasks—such as analyzing extensive data sets, selecting healthcare plans, or completing taxes—but AI-generated results can sometimes be unreliable. How can businesses trust AI-generated insights without constant human oversight?

Marko Klopets addresses this challenge, emphasizing the importance of keeping humans involved not merely as overseers but as collaborators who understand and interpret AI-driven insights.

## About Marko Klopets

Marko Klopets is the CEO and co-founder of Supersimple, a groundbreaking company transforming how product and marketing teams analyze and interpret data. Before Supersimple, Marko co-founded a B2B fintech startup and held key product and engineering roles developing enterprise AI applications.

## What is Supersimple?

Supersimple provides an intuitive analytics platform allowing users without extensive technical skills to quickly answer complex data-related questions. Its platform supports two main interaction models:

- **Natural Language Interface:** Leveraging conversational AI to simplify initial queries.
- **No-code User Interface:** Allowing iterative exploration and detailed customization by business users.

Supersimple's core innovation is its "semantic layer," which standardizes data definitions across companies, improving data consistency and trust.

## How Supersimple Enhances Data Reliability

Unlike traditional analytics solutions like Tableau or Microsoft Power BI, Supersimple:

- Utilizes an intermediate abstraction layer, preventing common AI "hallucinations" or inaccuracies.
- Offers clear, explainable steps, improving transparency and user confidence.
- Focuses on answering ad-hoc, iterative questions rapidly, rather than creating static dashboards.

Marko emphasizes that purely conversational interfaces aren't sufficient for all use cases; practical, structured interfaces are crucial for tasks like iterative data exploration and customization.

## The Future of AI in Data Analytics

Marko sees AI as an enabling technology—important but not inherently the main value proposition. He advises tech companies and startups to:

- Focus on solving real-world problems, not just leveraging AI because it's currently trending.
- Develop sustainable solutions that provide genuine value beyond hype.
