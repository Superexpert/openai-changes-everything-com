# How Domino's Pizza is Leveraging AI to Transform Retail

In this episode of the *Open AI Changes Everything* podcast, host Steven Walther speaks with Zachary Foso, Director of Data Science and Head of Machine Learning Operations at Domino's Pizza. They explore how Domino's, a traditional brick-and-mortar business, successfully incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) into its operations to enhance efficiency, customer experience, and competitive advantage.

## Domino's as a Tech Company Selling Pizza

Domino's Pizza has positioned itself uniquely as a "tech company that sells pizza," delivering over one billion pizzas globally each year. Despite its traditional product, Domino's leverages AI extensively to drive incremental improvements across operations and customer interactions.

## Key AI Use Cases at Domino's

Zachary highlights several primary use cases where AI significantly impacts Domino's retail operations:

- **Customer Experience:** Improving order accuracy, providing precise delivery times, and ensuring hotter, fresher pizza deliveries.
- **Store Efficiency:** Optimizing inventory management, supply chain logistics, and route optimization for deliveries.
- **Natural Language AI Assistants:** Domino's is collaborating with Microsoft to develop AI assistants that allow store employees to manage supply and delivery operations using intuitive, natural language interactions.

## The Impact of Generative AI

Generative AI (GenAI), such as large language models like ChatGPT, plays an important role in operational efficiency rather than flashy customer-facing applications. For instance:

- **Route Optimization:** AI-driven routing for deliveries and inventory supply chains.
- **Employee Empowerment:** Using GenAI assistants to help store teams easily access complex real-time data and recommendations, enhancing productivity.

## Successful AI Implementation and Change Management

Zachary emphasizes the critical importance of change management in AI adoption:

- Introducing AI-driven decisions must empower employees rather than simply automate their roles.
- Employees need clear communication about how AI enhances their roles, shifting focus from routine tasks to more strategic responsibilities.

## Hyper-Personalization and Data Privacy

The conversation addresses the concept of hyper-personalizationâ€”using AI to tailor marketing and product offerings to individual customers. Domino's approaches personalization carefully, focusing primarily on loyalty programs where customers explicitly opt-in, respecting data privacy and user preferences.

## Challenges and Future Trends

Discussing AI adoption challenges, Zachary references an unsuccessful McDonald's experiment using AI for drive-through order-taking, highlighting the difficulty of scaling AI solutions at the retail unit level. Despite these setbacks, he believes:

- Advances in natural language processing and AI technology will eventually make forms obsolete, leading to more intuitive customer interactions.
- Robotics and physical-world AI applications represent the next significant wave, particularly in food service industries facing persistent labor shortages.

## Entrepreneurship and AI

Reflecting on entrepreneurship, Zachary sees GenAI as transformative for rapidly developing business plans, marketing strategies, and operational efficiencies, significantly lowering barriers for new ventures.

## Staying Current with AI Developments

Zachary recommends:

- Engaging with practitioner-driven content such as podcasts, YouTube channels, and real-world case studies to understand practical AI applications and challenges.
- Focusing on resources from active industry professionals rather than solely academic or theoretical sources.

## Conclusion

Domino's Pizza's integration of AI illustrates how even traditional retail businesses can leverage cutting-edge technology for substantial improvements in efficiency, customer satisfaction, and competitive positioning. The episode underscores the necessity of thoughtful implementation and robust change management to fully realize AI's transformative potential.
