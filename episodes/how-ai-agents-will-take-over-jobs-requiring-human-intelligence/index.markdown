In this episode of the OpenAI Changes Everything podcast, host Stephen Walther sits down with Harneet Singh, widely recognized as the "Lion Founder" and innovative CEO behind Rabbit AI, a leading AI company specializing in sophisticated AI agents. Harneet, a seasoned entrepreneur and prominent AI thought leader, passionately discusses why he believes 2025 will be remembered as the definitive "Year of the AI Agent," transforming how businesses leverage artificial intelligence.

Harneet shares insights into his journey, from building websites in a small town in northern India to becoming one of Europe's top 100 AI leaders, having also consulted for international defense agencies. He details Rabbit AI's revolutionary focus on small language models (SLMs), emphasizing data privacy, on-premise hosting, and custom AI solutions tailored specifically to industry needs.

Key topics explored include:

- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Drawing analogies from historical industrial shifts, Harneet envisions a collaborative future where humans guide and supervise AI, enhancing productivity and enabling creativity rather than merely competing with technology.
