# How AI is Tackling Food Waste and Supporting Sustainability Goals

In this episode of **OpenAI Changes Everything**, host Stephen Walther speaks with Lawrence Stevens, co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of **Fridge Guide AI**, an innovative startup dedicated to reducing food waste through AI-driven solutions. Food waste is a massive global issue, with approximately 1.3 billion tons—around one-third of all food produced—being lost or wasted annually. In the U.S. alone, 30-40% of the food supply is wasted, significantly affecting grocery stores, food banks, and households.

## The Scale of Food Waste

Food waste isn't just a social issue—it's a major environmental crisis, responsible for 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, surpassing the environmental impact of the entire aviation sector. Recognizing this urgent issue, Stevens and his team at Fridge Guide AI have developed technology aimed at improving inventory management at food banks and ultimately reducing waste.

## AI as a Solution for Food Banks

Stevens highlights that food banks typically rely on manual methods, such as pen-and-paper tracking, making inventory management tedious and inefficient. Fridge Guide AI's platform leverages AI to streamline this process, helping employees and volunteers efficiently track donations, manage expiration dates, and reduce mislabeled food items. Early estimates indicate their system could cut food waste at food banks from 5% down to as low as 1%.

## Innovative Technology and Sustainability

Stevens shared his experience showcasing their product at the prestigious UN "AI for Good" Global Summit in Geneva, where innovators like Fridge Guide AI demonstrated practical AI solutions aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, Fridge Guide AI addresses SDG #2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG #12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).

## Future Expansion Beyond Food Banks

While food banks represent the initial target for Fridge Guide AI, Stevens envisions expanding their technology to include restaurants, cafes, and other businesses that could benefit from streamlined inventory management and simpler donation processes. The goal is to facilitate more efficient food donations, reduce administrative burdens, and improve access to tax incentives, encouraging businesses to contribute to solving the food waste crisis.

## How You Can Help

Fridge Guide AI is currently raising their pre-seed funding round and actively seeking partnerships with food banks to enhance their solutions. Interested parties, potential partners, and supporters are encouraged to reach out directly via the Fridge Guide AI [website](http://fridgeguide.ai).
