# How Turnitin's AI Detection is Shaping the Future of Education

In this episode of the **OpenAI Changes Everything** podcast, host Stephen Walther interviews **Dr. Eric Wang**, Vice President of AI at **Turnitin**, about the evolving role of AI in education, particularly Turnitin's groundbreaking AI writing detection software.

## What is Turnitin's AI Writing Detection Software?

Turnitin, used by over **21,000 institutions and 71 million students worldwide**, initially specialized in plagiarism detection. Now, their AI writing detection software employs Transformer-based text classifiers—the same technology underpinning popular AI models like GPT—to identify AI-generated content by analyzing statistical signatures in text.

## AI in Schools: Moving Beyond "Gotcha" Moments

Dr. Wang emphasizes that Turnitin’s goal is not to catch students cheating but rather to foster trust and transparency between students and teachers. He advocates shifting the mindset from "I gotcha" (catching cheaters) to "I got you" (supporting students and educators through the learning process). The software serves as a diagnostic tool, highlighting potential AI use to prompt productive, educational conversations.

## AI: Plagiarism or a New Educational Tool?

Dr. Wang clarifies that AI-assisted writing isn't necessarily plagiarism but can become a concern if used without transparency or against instructional guidelines. He envisions AI becoming integral to educational settings, helping students ideate, organize thoughts, and enhance critical thinking skills. Rather than outright bans, he recommends institutions develop thoughtful policies that guide the responsible use of AI.

## Accuracy and Challenges

Turnitin’s AI detection software achieves high accuracy, correctly identifying AI-generated content in tests with less than a 1% error rate. However, Dr. Wang acknowledges false positives occasionally occur, stressing the importance of nuanced teacher-student discussions and the broader institutional context when interpreting results.

## The Future of Homework and Education

Dr. Wang predicts a significant shift in educational paradigms, suggesting AI could enable more personalized learning experiences. He envisions educational practices moving towards continuous learning, with AI providing individualized support akin to personalized Socratic tutoring. This approach could even lead to more homework and less traditional classroom time as students engage with AI-supported educational activities outside formal settings.

## The Role of Teachers and Policy

Dr. Wang underscores the critical role of educational policies in shaping AI usage. He recommends schools and universities update their policies to reflect current realities and promote AI as a beneficial educational tool rather than a threat. This approach would encourage students and educators alike to harness AI positively and constructively.

## Advice and Resources for Educators

To effectively integrate AI, Dr. Wang suggests:

- Exploring Turnitin's extensive resources on responsible AI integration.
- Experimenting personally with AI technologies like ChatGPT to understand their educational potential.

## Final Thoughts

Ultimately, Dr. Wang believes that while AI offers immense potential, the core educational mission remains fostering human qualities—empathy, creativity, curiosity, and collaboration. He encourages educators to lean into these attributes to better prepare students for a future where human-AI collaboration becomes the norm.
